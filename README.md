# Maza Turi [3] Keyboard (M3K)
### An HTML keyboard so inspired by the game Mother 3, that publishing this repository in the United States may get me into legal trouble (just like Mother 3 and its music).
### JP TRANSLATION HERE

# English

## Main Function
This keyboard lets you translate Japanese text into English by pressing [Enter] on [おれり] and English text into Japanese by pressing [Shift] while pressing [Enter] on [おれり].

## Using Maza 3 Keyboard
It should be compatible with keyboards, mice, and your fingers. It works just like any keyboard; just click the keys and see the input appear above. 

## Controls
Press Ctrl+L or Cmd+L to mute/unmute the music. 

## Limitations
This keyboard uses DeepL for translation and requires going to a different tab to finish the translation on DeepL's end. This keyboard also cannot handle [POISON] well.

## Features
The entire Latin Alphabet, parts of the Greek Alphabet, many special characters, Hiragana, and Katakana. This keyboard features sounds heavily inspired (extracted) from Mother 3, as well as styles (identical) similar to Mother 3. This keyboard is natively compatible with dark mode and has an [ALERT] system. You can also [もどる] and [もどる] the keyboard.  

## Disclaimer
This keyboard is not meant to ridicule the game; I made this as an accessibility tool. This keyboard also makes a lot of sounds.

# Japaneese
